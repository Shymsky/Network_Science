<p align="justify"> We would like to compare a set of currently known algorithms to identify important spreaders
in the context of the Twitch Social Network. The choice, which algorithms will be used for
comparison, is also subject to our research. We will, however, focus on state of the art
algorithms. We have already created an initial list of possible algorithms, as seen in the
appendix, from which we will choose the best fitting options. The currently existing literature
already investigated the topic of comparing the algorithms on different datasets, however we
would like to focus on a specific type of network, which has not been explored before.
Therefore, the research question can be formulated as follows:</p>

  context of the Twitch Social Network?</b></i></p>
